# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – Ronald Walker

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab and blue-team portfolio.  
I am a **CompTIA Security+ certified** cybersecurity professional focused on SOC operations, defensive security, and hands-on technical skills.

This repository showcases:
- 🧪 **Hands-on labs** (network scanning, log analysis, incident response)
- 🧰 **Python security tools** (log parser, port scanner, integrity checker)
- 🛡️ **Blue team playbooks** (brute force attack, SSH hardening)
- 🐳 **Docker & home lab architecture** (multi-container security toolkit)
- 📘 **Security+ notes** that demonstrate my understanding of all core domains
- 📄 **Skills overview** for recruiters and hiring managers

This portfolio is continuously updated as I grow in defensive security, automation, and threat detection.
