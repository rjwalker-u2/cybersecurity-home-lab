# Security+ Notes

High-level concepts I’ve studied and want to keep sharp.

## 1. Risk Management
- Identify → Assess → Treat → Monitor
- Common responses: Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate
- Importance of asset inventory and data classification

## 2. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Principles: Least privilege, role-based access control (RBAC), separation of duties
- MFA, SSO, conditional access

## 3. Incident Response
- Phases: Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned
- Runbooks and playbooks are critical for repeatable response

*(Work in progress — I’ll expand as I keep studying.)*
