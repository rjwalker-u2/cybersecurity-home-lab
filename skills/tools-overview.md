# 🧠 Core Cybersecurity Skills

### **Blue Team / Defensive Security**
- Log analysis (system logs, auth logs, application logs)
- Detecting brute-force attacks and suspicious activity
- Basic incident triage (NIST framework)
- Containment & remediation steps
- File integrity monitoring
- SSH hardening & secure configuration

### **Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC)**
- Understanding of risk management concepts
- Familiarity with data handling and HIPAA workflows
- Recognizing compliance implications of authentication failures
- Documentation and incident reporting

### **Security Operations (SOC)**
- Alert triage and classification  
- Investigating failed login attempts  
- Using multiple detection techniques (manual + Python scripts)  
- Following incident response lifecycle

# 👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies

### **Scripting & Coding**
- Python (log parsing, port scanning, hashing)
- Basic automation and CLI usage

### **Security Tools**
- Nmap (scanning, enumeration)
- SSH security & configuration
- Fail2ban concepts (rate limiting)
- Hashing & integrity checks

### **Log Analysis**
- Manual grep investigation
- Keyword analysis
- Event pattern detection
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings

### **Virtualization & Containers**
- Docker fundamentals  
- Multi-container applications  
- Docker Compose  
- Non-root user setup  
- Container healthchecks  

*(My older Mac cannot run Docker, but all Docker labs are done on a newer laptop.)*

### **Operating Systems**
- Linux basics (file system, logs, SSH)
- macOS (terminal usage, logs)

# 📚 Certifications & Knowledge Areas

- **CompTIA Security+**  
- IAM concepts (MFA, RBAC, least privilege)  
- Incident response processes  
- Network fundamentals (ports, protocols, scanning)

# 🧪 Hands-On Projects Inside This Repo

- Network scanning lab  
- Log analysis lab  
- Home lab architecture planning  
- SSH brute-force incident simulation  
- Python-based security tools  
- Blue team playbooks  
- Docker notes and multi-container security toolkit (in progress)

# 🏁 Summary

This repository represents my active journey into cybersecurity, combining:
- Defensive security  
- SOC analysis  
- Python scripting  
- Containerization  
- Home lab engineering  

I am continually updating this portfolio as I build new tools, complete new labs, and expand my home lab environment.
